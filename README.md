# INSTALL


# Ransom-Cracker

A Python program that will crack the zip file’s password using the brute force method.

The ZIP file format is a common archive and compression standard. It is used to compress files. Sometimes, compressed files are confidential and the owner doesn’t want to give its access to every individual. Hence, the zip file is protected with a password. If the password is common then it’s easily crack-able. Here, we’ll use the brute force method to crack the zip file’s password.

How to Brute Force ZIP File Passwords in Python?
A brute force method is a method where a set of predefined values are used to crack a password until successful. This is basically a “hit and try” method. This method might take a long time if the set of values are high, but its success rate is high. The more the number of values, the greater the chances of cracking passwords. Here we’ll be using “rockyou” text file of size 133 MB with over 14 million sets of passwords to try.
